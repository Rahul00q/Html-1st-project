            <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web.
               HTML is a markup language, not a programming language, meaning it annotates text to define how it is structured and displayed by web browsers.
               It forms the building blocks of all websites and is complemented by CSS for style and JavaScript for interactivity
            </p>
            <p>
                In a nutshell, HTML is all about organizing and displaying information on a webpage. 
                We can think of it as the bones or structure of a webpage.

        <p>
            HTML Tags are fundamental elements used to structure and format content on web pages. 
            They provide instructions to web browsers on how to render text, images, links, and other media.
        </p>
        <p>
            HTML tags are enclosed in angle brackets < > and usually come in pairs: 
            an opening tag and a closing tag. 
            The closing tag has the same text as the opening tag, 
            but with an additional forward-slash /. 
            The opening tag marks the beginning of an element, while the closing tag marks the end.

  <h2>Attributes</h2>
  <article>
    <p>
        HTML Attributes are special words used within the opening tag of an HTML element.
         They provide additional information about HTML elements. 
         HTML attributes are used to configure and adjust the element’s behavior, appearance, 
         or functionality in a variety of ways.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each attribute has a name and a value, formatted as name=”value”.
         Attributes tell the browser how to render the element or how it should behave during user interactions.
